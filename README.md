# Jedha Projects
Python code for weekly projects while studying my Bachelor @Jedha Bootcamp.

**These projects are now outdated and most of the code is to be re-written in a more efficient and mathematically correct way.**

1. *To do* : Python language basics, OOP.
2. *Speed dating* : EDA on a speed dating dataset.
3. *Conversion rate and fraud* : Binary classifications. EDA could be heavily improved. Statistical mistakes were made, information was leaked to test set and/or to the model several times.
4. *Uber* : Clustering uber rides. The code is extremely repetitive and the notebook way too heavy due to too many visualizations. Needs to be cleaned up.
